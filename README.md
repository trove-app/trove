- **Isolated data exploration** - each connection is completely separate

### Quick Start with Connections

1. **Navigate to DB Connections** in the sidebar
2. **Add your first connection** with your database credentials
3. **Select it** from the dropdown on any page
4. **Start exploring** - schema and queries automatically use your selected connection

For detailed setup and architecture information, see our [Database Connections Documentation](docs/database-connections.md).
