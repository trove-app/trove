# 🔑 trove

**Trove** is a treasure chest for your startup's data. It's an open source data exploration and observability tool made for *everyone*—PMs, EMs, marketers, partner teams, and engineers alike.

Forget per-seat pricing, clunky dashboards, and gatekeeping. With Trove, your whole crew can pull, explore, and share insights from your data—fast, friendly, and free.

> **💡 Built for startups.**  
> No heavy setup, no complex roles (unless you want that), just data when and where you need it.
