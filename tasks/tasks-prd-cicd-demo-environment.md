# Tasks for CI/CD Pipeline Demo Environment Setup

## Relevant Files

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Main GitHub Actions workflow file for CI/CD pipeline
- `.github/workflows/rollback.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for manual rollback process
- `deploy/docker-compose.yml` - Docker Compose configuration for the demo environment ✅
- `deploy/nginx.conf` - Nginx reverse proxy configuration ✅
- `deploy/init-letsencrypt.sh` - Script to initialize Let's Encrypt SSL certificates ✅
- `deploy/deploy.sh` - Main deployment script to be run on the GCE instance ✅
- `deploy/rollback.sh` - Script for manual rollback procedures ✅
- `deploy/health-check.sh` - Script for monitoring service health ✅
- `deploy/renew-ssl.sh` - Script for automating SSL certificate renewal ✅
- `deploy/cleanup.sh` - Script for cleaning up old images and containers ✅
- `deploy/README.md` - Documentation for the deployment setup and processes ✅
- `deploy/Makefile` - Contains deployment-specific commands and targets ✅
- `Makefile` - Contains development commands and forwards deployment commands ✅
- `deploy/env.example` - Example environment variables file for deployment ✅

### Notes

- All deployment-related files will be stored in the `deploy/` directory for better organization
- Scripts should be thoroughly documented with clear usage instructions
- Sensitive information like credentials should never be committed to the repository
- The Makefile structure separates development and deployment concerns
