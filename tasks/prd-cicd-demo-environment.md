# CI/CD Pipeline for Demo Environment

## Introduction/Overview
This PRD outlines the implementation of a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for automatically deploying the Trove application to a demo environment. The pipeline will be triggered on merges to the main branch and will handle the building and deployment of multiple Docker images (frontend, backend, and database) to a Google Compute Engine instance.

## Goals
1. Automate the deployment process to reduce manual intervention
2. Ensure consistent and reliable deployments
3. Minimize deployment costs while maintaining functionality
4. Provide a simple and maintainable deployment infrastructure

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want my merged code to automatically deploy to the demo environment so that stakeholders can see the latest changes without manual intervention
- As a developer, I want to be able to manually rollback deployments if issues are detected
- As a project maintainer, I want the demo environment to be cost-effective and simple to maintain

## Functional Requirements

### GitHub Actions Pipeline
1. The pipeline must trigger automatically when code is merged into the main branch
2. The pipeline must build Docker images for:
   - Frontend application
   - Backend application
   - Database (Postgres)
3. The pipeline must tag built images with both:
   - Latest tag
   - Git commit SHA for versioning
4. The pipeline must push built images to Google Container Registry (GCR)
5. The pipeline must trigger deployment to the GCE instance

### Google Cloud Infrastructure
1. The system must maintain a single e2-micro/e2-small GCE instance in us-central region
2. The instance must have:
   - Docker installed
   - Docker Compose installed
   - Appropriate firewall rules (80/443 for web access)
3. The instance must be configured with necessary GCR pull permissions
4. The instance must run a reverse proxy (Nginx) for SSL termination
5. The instance must use Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates

### Deployment Process
1. The system must pull the latest images from GCR
2. The system must use Docker Compose to orchestrate the containers
3. The system must support manual rollback to previous versions if needed
4. The system must handle database recreation during each deployment

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Multiple environment support (staging, etc.)
2. Automated testing in the pipeline
3. Advanced monitoring or alerting
4. Automated rollbacks
5. High availability setup
6. Persistent data storage
7. Custom access controls

## Technical Considerations
1. Docker Compose file should be maintained in the repository
2. SSL certificate renewal process should be automated via Let's Encrypt
3. Instance should use minimal resources to keep costs low
4. Database will be ephemeral and recreated with each deployment
5. Service account permissions should follow principle of least privilege

## Success Metrics
1. Successful automatic deployment on every merge to main branch
2. Deployment time under 10 minutes
3. No manual intervention required for standard deployments
4. Successful SSL/TLS termination and certificate management

## Implementation Steps Overview
1. Set up Google Cloud infrastructure
   - Create GCP project (if not exists)
   - Configure GCR
   - Provision GCE instance
   - Configure networking and firewall rules

2. Configure GCE Instance
   - Install Docker and Docker Compose
   - Configure reverse proxy and SSL
   - Set up GCR authentication

3. Create GitHub Actions Workflow
   - Configure GCP authentication
   - Set up Docker build steps
   - Configure deployment triggers

4. Create Deployment Scripts
   - Docker Compose configuration
   - Deployment automation script
   - Rollback script

## Open Questions
1. Should we implement any form of deployment notifications (e.g., Slack)?
2. What is the preferred domain name for the demo environment?
3. Should we implement any basic uptime monitoring?
4. What is the preferred strategy for managing GCP credentials in GitHub Actions?
