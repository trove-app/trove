# Trove Design System PRD
_Product Requirements Document for Trove's Frontend Design System_

## Introduction/Overview
Trove needs a centralized, maintainable design system that follows our established brand guidelines while providing flexibility for future updates. The system will standardize our UI components, reduce inconsistencies, and speed up development while maintaining our "data gold" brand identity.

## Goals
1. Create a centralized theme system that can be easily modified
2. Standardize existing UI components under a consistent design language
3. Implement type-safe components with Tailwind + CSS
4. Support both light and dark modes
5. Maintain the warm, inviting aesthetic defined in our style guide
6. Reduce dependency on external UI libraries where possible

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want to use pre-built, styled components that match Trove's design language
- As a designer, I want to update the theme in one place and have changes propagate throughout the app
- As a developer, I want type-safe props for components to catch errors early
- As a PM, I want our UI to maintain consistency across all features
- As a user, I want a cohesive, visually pleasing interface that works in both light and dark modes

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Theme System
1.1. Create a centralized theme configuration with:
- Color palette from style guide (`#FFF7EC`, `#2A2A2A`, `#F4B100`, `#A25D2D`, `#1A1A1A`)
- Typography settings (Poppins/Inter for headings, Nunito/Lato for body)
- Spacing scales
- Border radius values
- Shadow definitions
- Animation/transition timings

1.2. Implement CSS custom properties for theme values
1.3. Create dark mode variants for all colors
1.4. Provide theme context provider for dynamic updates

### 2. Core Components (Based on Existing Usage)
2.1. Typography
- Heading components (h1-h6)
- Body text components
- Code text component

2.2. Input Components
- Text input
- Select/Dropdown
- Pills/Tags
- Search input

2.3. Layout Components
- Container
- Grid system
- Card
- Section dividers

2.4. Interactive Elements
- Primary button
- Secondary button
- Icon button
- Links

2.5. Data Display
- Data table
- Status indicators
- Loading states

### 3. Technical Requirements
3.1. Use TypeScript for all components
3.2. Implement Tailwind + CSS for styling
3.3. Create reusable hooks for common interactions
3.4. Ensure all components are responsive
3.5. Add aria labels and roles for accessibility
3.6. Include prop documentation

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Component playground/Storybook (stretch goal)
2. Complex animation library
3. Components not currently used in the application
4. Migration away from all external libraries immediately
5. Extensive unit testing in first pass

## Design Considerations
1. Follow "warm, inviting colors with low contrast backgrounds" principle
2. Use Treasure Gold (`#F4B100`) for primary actions and highlights
3. Implement rounded corners and subtle shadows as per style guide
4. Maintain generous whitespace between sections
5. Use line-based icons with thick strokes
6. Include sparkle/nugget motifs where appropriate

## Technical Considerations
1. Gradual migration from Mantine components
2. CSS-in-JS avoided in favor of Tailwind + CSS
3. Theme values accessible via CSS custom properties
4. Mobile-first responsive design
5. Performance optimization for style delivery

## Success Metrics
1. 100% of new components follow design system
2. Reduced time to implement new features
3. Consistent visual appearance across all pages
4. Improved developer experience (measured by feedback)
5. Reduced CSS bundle size
6. Improved accessibility scores

## Open Questions
1. Should we create a separate package for the design system or keep it in the main repo?
2. What is the priority order for migrating existing Mantine components?
3. Do we need to support any specific browser versions?
4. Should we implement CSS Modules or stick with pure Tailwind?
5. What is the preferred method for documenting components?
